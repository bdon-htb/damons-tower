Each element in tileData's array is structured like: [x-y-ID] where
- x and y are the location of the tile's sprite in the tileMap's spriteSheet (based on array-like index)
- ID is the ID of the tile. The game will look at this to determine things like collidability and other
  properties.
- Note that for the empty tile (has id 00), the x and y values will be ignored as the renderer will simply
  not draw anything for an empty tile space. For consistency's sake they will still be required though. 
  So empty tiles will probably end up being something like '0-0-00' but it could theoretically
  be something like '9-1-00' for the same effect.
