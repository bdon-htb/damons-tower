/**
 * game.js contains the "game object"  itself. It separates the systems code
 * from all the code that will be unique to the application.
 * game.js will be in charge of changing game state (not system state)
 * and setting up how levels and menus will be organized.
 * (will probably be combined into one file with logic.js at a later date).
